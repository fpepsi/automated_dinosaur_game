Automated Google Chrome's offline dinosaur game using PyAutoGUI and Pillow
This game is sensitive to image processing speed and won't work with some older computers (didnt work well on my macbook air 2015).
It also needs fine tuning on the detection of obstacles, as Dino may not be successful jumping under some obstacle combinations.
The solution is simple, just play with the obstacle detection window size, or add another one, so it covers more adverse scenarios.
